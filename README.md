## Attribution
This work is released under [The MIT License](./LICENSE). It uses a parser generated by [PEG.js](http://pegjs.org/) for parsing, and [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net/) with packages for syntax highlighting.

This uses notation from Warren S. Goldfarb's book [Deductive Logic](http://www.hackettpublishing.com/deductive-logic).

The starting framework of code was taken from [an earlier project of mine](https://github.com/gauravmm/AbacusMachineSim).

## Language
Navelgazer is designed to be a simple logic linter that both formats input and checks synax and the application of various rules. The language is similar to the specification in the later chapters in [Deductive Logic](http://www.hackettpublishing.com/deductive-logic), and this is intended to be used to help teach that at introductory logic courses in universities.

The following checks are made:
 - Syntax

## Parser

The Parser is built using PEG.js, using the following command:
```
./node_modules/pegjs/bin/pegjs -e parser --allowed-start-rules Code,Expression language.pegjs parser.js
```
